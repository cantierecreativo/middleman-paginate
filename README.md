# Middleman::Paginate

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/middleman/paginate`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'middleman-paginate'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install middleman-paginate

## Usage

Consider that middleman-paginate creates a page for each set of data sliced from your collection. This page is created by a template. In your config.rb

    paginate data.your_collection, "/episodes", "/templates/episodes.html"

in your pagination template you'll find a collection named ``Ã¬tems``` representig the available data.

    - items.each do |episode|
        p = episode.title

You also have an object ```pager``` that offers some helpers to build the pagination links.

    - if pager.next_page
        = link_to "Next page", pager.page_path(pager.next_page)
    - if pager.previous_page
        = link_to "Previous page", pager.page_path(pager.previous_page)

The final url will be

    http://127.0.0.1:4567/episodes/page/1.html

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
